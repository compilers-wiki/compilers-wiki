# Compilers Wiki

## Why?

Compiler optimizations and related principles are taught in university courses and university textbooks, while there are a large number of documents for program optimization performed by compilation technology, but they are scattered everywhere and cannot be studied intensively. This warehouse is a description document that contains a large number of compiler-related optimization technologies. The content is mainly high-level design principles and design implementations.
